# Mini-Projects and Practice

Here are some mini-projects, experimentations, and practice work. Projects come in the form of notebooks with heavy documentation, and may include a theoretical treatment and report. There are also several routines that are developed in each respective folder under "Functions" folder. 

Please email me at nikeet1@gmail.com or comment here if any questions! 

Cheers
