# Harmonic Analysis and Image Processing Practice 

In this course, theoretical application overviewed dimensionality reduction transforms
like Fourier and Wavelets with application to DSP. Further, we looked at image filtering
techniques and enhancement methods in both the frequency and space domain and image restoration. 
Various algorithms for filtering and other processing needs have been developed and are uploaded here. 

## Medium-Project 3 

In this project, I performed exhaustive testing (30+ pages). I surveyed periodic noise 
reduction, Weiner, constrained least squares, and inverse filtering. I combined theoretical knowledge
and use it to drive experimental testing. 

## Mini-Project 2
In this project, I surveyed filtering in the frequency domain with testing and application. 

## Mini-Project 3
In this project, I surveyed filtering in the frequency domain with testing and application
